# Epic-Dungeon
Console Game "Epic Dungeon"
Made a console game in C++ "Epic dungeon", which my friend did a year ago in JS. 
I decided to do it in order to gain experience
(in fact, I did it because I would have stopped learning c++ if I hadn't done something, because studying for so long and not doing anything can quickly get bored) 
I did it without using OOP, because I still don't know it well. 
At times it may seem to you that I was on LSD, but this is not so. 
I'll immediately answer the question: "Why did I make the choose variable char?" 
Because if you make the variable int and write any character(you can do it accidentally and it will be a shame because you have to restart) 
then infinite recursion of functions will go, and if it is char then this will not happen.
